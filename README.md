# Welcome
Welcome to my portfolio website! This is a full-stack project, where the front-end was bootstrapped with ReactJS and ThreeJS and the backend was implemented in ExpressJS and NodeJS with a MongoDB database. 

I wanted to make this website do more than just showcase my projects, but also showcase my personality - hence, the theme for this website being around "Spirited Away", one of my favorite "Studio Ghibli" movies of all time.
